# BlockNova Labs

## ðŸ§© Project Description
**BlockNova Labs** is a decentralized blockchain protocol that enables users to securely **store, manage, and retrieve their data** on-chain. It uses smart contracts to ensure immutability, transparency, and privacy-preserving data storage through external storage references like IPFS.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision
To establish a **trustless and secure on-chain data registry system** where users control their data while leveraging decentralized technology for verification, transparency, and accessibility.

---

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **User Registration:** Users can register their name and data (e.g., IPFS hash) on the blockchain.
- **Data Update:** Registered users can securely update their stored data.
- **Data Retrieval:** Anyone can fetch a userâ€™s registered information publicly.
- **Event Logging:** Every action is logged through blockchain events for transparency.

---

## ðŸ”® Future Scope
- Integrate **encryption** for secure private data storage.
- Add **access control mechanisms** for restricted data visibility.
- Build a **frontend dashboard** to visualize and manage user data.
- Introduce **cross-chain compatibility** for wider interoperability.
